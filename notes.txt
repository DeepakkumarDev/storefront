introduction to data modeling

product 
title
description
price
inventory

Collection
title



we have to esatblish or association between product and collection 
1 to many relationship benween product and collection




relationship can be 
one to one
one to many
many to many


Building an Ecommerce Data model

product 0-1 collection



product *-* cart (many to many from product to cart)
        created_at

            |
            |
            |
 product 1 -* cartItem-0-1 -cart
        quantity
Cartitem is an association class

any one can have cart whether they are regostered user or not


product     customer

     *-*       order*-1

many to many relationship with product and order 
and 1 to many relationship with customer and order

ordeitem is association class between prodcut and order

product to order item one to many relationship


prodcut *-* tag

product to tag can have many to many relationship



apps in django has different functionality


we can have single apps like store
product
collection
cart
cartitem
order
orderitem
customer

But theres is a problem here
as this application grow it will be loded with too many fields


this is called Monolith 
it will radd to use and modify

we van brek it into many apps
products         customers      cart        orders
product           customer      cart        order
collection                      cartitem    orderitem 
tag


carts depend on products applicationorders depend on cart and customers app
but there is problem

if you publish a products that migh cost cart and orders app
since we need to upgrade all the app together more work
and downot make sense  having shping cart functility without having product catalog



so we should crete a two app one is store and another tags
store               tags
product             Tag
collection          TaggedItem
customer
cart
cartitem
order
orderitem
it is self contained and zero coupling
we should desgin MINIMAL COUPLING
HIGH COHESION (FOCUS)
